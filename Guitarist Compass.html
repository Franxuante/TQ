<p>I created this chart on a whim. It's based my own aesthetics and surely very <br/>biased. If you are curious about my criteria, you can check out Piero Scaruffi's <br/>website scaruffi.com. Once a friend told me that my way to approach aesthetics <br/>in music is quite similar to Scaruffi&#8217;s. I checked his website, and I actually agreed <br/>to at least 60% of his stuff. The major difference is that I&#8217;m more technical driven <br/>in assessing rock music, or at least guitar players. Scaruffi also published a list of <br/>best rock guitarists of all time https://www.scaruffi.com/music/guitar.html. I <br/>found some parts quite intriguing. Yet it seemed that Scaruffi, with a deeper <br/>root in jazz and classics, hadn't paid enough attention to rock guitar music, <br/>especially the footage of some rare live performances (There&#8217;s no list of all-time <br/>best rock performances on his website. It&#8217;s understandable since the internet <br/>didn&#8217;t prevail in the last century.). <br/> <br/><b>Brief interpretation of each quadrant:  <br/>Up: Graceful <br/></b></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/><b>Down: Cringe <br/>Left: slow hands. Since some players are more rhythm-driven, this could be <br/>also be righteously misinterpreted as non-shredders. <br/>Right: shredders <br/> <br/>Red Quadrant: LESS IS MORE, ingenuity, artsy. <br/>Blue Quadrants: MORE IS MORE, virtuosity, craftsmanship, discipline. <br/>Green Quadrant: LESS IS LESS, boring or simply unqualified as a professional <br/>(harsh). <br/>Purple Quadrant: MORE IS LESS, bullshitting, some not aware of their <br/>tawdriness, some just technocrats. <br/></b> <br/>A player&#8217;s influence or achievements is not a major criterion to assess his level of <br/>grace. Instead, it largely comes from a purely aesthetic perspective. It is <br/>definitely possible for a cringe player to exert a major influence on a graceful <br/>player. Wise players can synthesise and refine what they were fed with. If you <br/>tend to assess an artist by the sales of their artworks or popularity, my website <br/>might be a hostile place for you.  <br/> <br/>Due to the limitation of space, many other guitarists that one idolises or loathes <br/>might not be included. Some excellent guitar players like Dave Mustaine, James <br/>Hetfield, and Billy Corgan are mainly in charge of rhythm and songwriting in <br/>their groups. I&#8217;d rather not include them in this chart, since it primarily aims to <br/>assess lead players or guitarists with a regular solo career. It will be better to <br/>evaluate those rhythm and songwriting geniuses with another chart. On the <br/>perfect centrist point lie Page and SRV, whose names are blurred by the axis.  <br/> <br/>Don take this chart seriously, peace. <br/> <br/>Catalogue of Appendixes: <br/> <br/><b>I: Brief remarks on each player from the chart by quadrant                                2 <br/>II: Top 20 electric (mostly rock) guitarists of all time                                           13 <br/>III: Nominations for a few acoustic guitar GOATS                                                 14 <br/>IV: Top 50 rock guitar solos of all time (live, recorded, or in other forms)       14 <br/>V: 5 must-listen guitar albums                                                                                  18 <br/></b> <br/></p>
<p><b>Appendix I: Brief Remarks on Each Player from the Chart by <br/>Quadrant  <br/></b> <br/></p>
<p><b>Red Quadrant <br/></b> <br/><b>Jimi Hendrix</b> <br/>The GOAT of electric guitar. A lofty concept for every guitar player. <br/>In addition to reinventing blues and rock, he might be the only one here who can translate any <br/>image, senses, or hallucinations into licks. Technically speaking, I am more drawn to his <br/></p>
<p>2 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>rhythms than his coarse yet spiritually transcendental leads &#8212; or maybe they&#8217;re inseparable. <br/>He blended chords and melodies to unlock the piano function of guitar. <br/> <br/><b>Prince</b> <br/>The GOAT of pop. A godly man who plunged the concept of &#8216;entertainment&#8217; into an <br/>unfathomable depth and a versatile maestro who levitated pop music to an unprecedented <br/>altitude. He had the best phrasing I have ever seen. Adding or subtracting any note from any <br/>of his licks would diminish its musicality. His solo over &#8216;Something in the Water&#8217; (sound check <br/>in Miami, 1985) is my all-time favourite.  <br/> <br/><b>John Frusciante</b> <br/>A water down of every pre-90s rock sage and a trailblazer during the 00s. The ultimate bundle <br/>of new wave, punk, funk, blues rock, hard rock, alt rock, art rock, prog rock, avant music, and <br/>IDM. My all-time greatest influence. SEE MY 4700-WORD BLOG ON HIM. <br/> <br/><b>Rory Gallagher</b>  <br/>Criminally underrated blues master admired by Hendrix. He merged Irish folk music into <br/>blues, which diversified his note choices and rendered a fresher style. His hexatonics <br/>outplayed others&#8217; pentatonics or blues scales. He can instigate chaos and mayhem with a few <br/>slightly overdriven notes. His life is a miniature of musical dedication and tragic heroism. <br/> <br/><b>Frank Zappa</b> <br/>Anti-establishment, anti-boredom, counter-counterculture warrior and intellectual. With <br/>Captain Beefheart, he experimented and realised Stravinsky&#8217;s avant ideas on guitar. The <br/>perennial game changer. The GOAT of rock composition.  <br/> <br/><b>Eddie Hazel</b>  <br/>The OG of groove in rock guitar. He narrated African (American) myths and lores through his <br/>groove. He initiated psychedelic funk. Maggot Brain is a monument in guitar history. <br/> <br/><b>Peter Green</b>:  <br/>As criminally underrated as Rory, he made blues exotic. The one who knows where to stop the <br/>best. A white (or Jewish) B. B. King. <br/> <br/><b>Syd Barrett</b>:  <br/>Prog rock started here. The very first to make &#8216;emo&#8217; music with an electric guitar. He <br/>concocted a grandiose, startling, yet appalling scene of mental havoc on six strings. Only <br/>Frusciante&#8217;s Niandra Lades had come close. <br/> <br/><b>Roy Buchanan</b>:  <br/>He has a unique interpretation of the blues classics. So bluesy that I almost felt blue blood <br/>running in his veins. <br/> <br/><b>Tom Verlaine</b>  <br/>With Richard Lloyd, he defined guitar virtuosity in new wave rock by maximising the use of <br/>diatonic and modal scales. He delivered magnificence through nonchalant playing. I can hear <br/>iron melting and oxygen frosting in his delicate tone.  <br/> <br/><b>Terje Rypdal</b> <br/>Scandinavian comfort in jazz fusion.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p>3 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/><b>Adrian Belew</b> <br/>Among the first few to make non-guitar music with a guitar. He really pushed the boundaries. <br/> <br/><b>Robert Fripp</b> <br/>It's incredible that this dude can write alien riffs and exquisite yet accessible solos with <br/>deliberate treatment of the intervals.  <br/> <br/><b>Omar Rodriguez</b>  <br/>An anti-guitar hero who&#8217;s actually very technical to navigate hostile meters change and <br/>complex arpeggios. One of the most avant and alternative guys in this century. <br/> <br/><b>Hillel Slovak</b> <br/>A sultry storm. He made history by mingling hard rock, funk, and psychedelic rock. Godfather <br/>of heavy funk. Ephemeral nameless hero.  <br/> <br/><b>Trey Anastasio</b> <br/>A bridge between 70s fusion and 90s alt/indie wave. He showed people that jam band rules. <br/> <br/><b>Jeff Beck</b> <br/>Epitome of &#8216;less is more&#8217; with his magic thumb and whammy. <br/> <br/><b>Lou Reed</b> <br/>He did way more than he could with limited technical proficiency. He knew how to behave <br/>himself, given that he was a noob. Besides, he invented new wave. <br/> <br/><b>Sonny Sharrock</b> <br/>Mystical wizard of jazz fusion, folk, and psychedelia. <br/> <br/><b>Tony Iommi</b> <br/>HEAVY METAL BEGAN HERE! What made him a bit low here is his limit in melodic phrasing.  <br/> <br/><b>Larry Carlton</b> <br/>A crucial figure for 70s fusion/rnb guitar. Larry stands for sweetness and humour. <br/> <br/><b>J Mascis</b>  <br/>It's unbelievable that he created the alt/indie vibe with a crunchy, fuzzy tone when nobody <br/>was playing indie rock and he was even unaware that he played the so-called &#8216;indie rock.&#8217; <br/> <br/><b>David Gilmour</b>:  <br/>Super expressive with slow, lyrical melodies. However, he&#8217;s actually not that prog. He&#8217;s not <br/>comparable to his predecessor in Pink Floyd. <br/> <br/><b>Marc Bolan</b>:  <br/>An underrated figure in glam rock. Better than David Bowie. <br/> <br/><b>Andy Summers</b>  <br/>Sweet chords to torture small hands lol. Anyway, he was once in Soft Machines. He <br/>understood prog music, though he didn&#8217;t play that much. <br/> <br/><b>Frank Marino</b> <br/>His blues sounds more energetic and fresh than most of his contemporary peers. <br/></p>
<p>4 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/> <br/><b>Mike McCready</b> <br/>Hendrix in grunge. Very underrated. Black is my favourite &#8216;simp ballad&#8217; in rock n&#8217; roll. I could <br/>hear swords and shields in the outro solo. Simping doesn&#8217;t impede it from increasing the <br/>audience&#8217;s testosterone.  <br/> <br/><b>Joe Walsh</b> <br/>Albeit cliche, we have to acknowledge that he&#8217;s a good country rock player who&#8217;s quite versed <br/>in both picking and finger styles.  <br/> <br/><b>Robben Ford</b> <br/>An underrated 70s blues/rnb guitarist that had something special. Just a little more boring <br/>than Carlton.  <br/> <br/><b>Carlos Santana</b> <br/>His Latin grooves and unique melodic arrangements made him stand out in the blues <br/>community full of monotony.  <br/> <br/><b>Johnny Marr</b> <br/>King of arpeggios. That&#8217;s his only strength, but it&#8217;s very enough. <br/> <br/><b>James Iha</b> <br/>With Billy Corgan, he helped Smashing Pumpkins secure an important niche in the 90s alt <br/>rock scene with roaring yet languid riffs and solos. <br/> <br/><b>Cory Wong</b> <br/>Someone might consider him a cringe, but bringing the rhythm guitar to the front in the <br/>2010s and 2020s is not as easy as imagined!  <br/> <br/><b>Joe Perry</b> <br/>He made Aerosmith sound good but mediocre at the same time. <br/> <br/> <br/></p>
<p><b>Blue Quadrant <br/></b> <br/><b>Allan Holdsworth</b> <br/>Some call him the Coltrane or Messiaen of the guitar, others the Euclid of guitar-oriented <br/>music theory. Yet such titles barely graze the facade of his genius. The only legit verdict is: <br/>ALIEN ONLY VISITS EARTH ONCE. <br/> <br/><b>John McLaughlin</b> <br/>No matter in the Mahavishna Orchestra or in his solo career, he demonstrated his virtuosity in <br/>almost every genre. He could emulate Hendrixy blues licks as well as a gypsy jazz solo. He&#8217;s <br/>more avant than most &#8216;avant&#8217; or &#8216;prog&#8217; rock guitarists.  <br/> <br/><b>Shawn Lane</b> <br/>As a humble learner of Indian traditions, he became the most technical guitarist in history. No <br/>one else can play 18 notes in one second while maintaining melodic smoothness. Unlike other <br/>aggressive shredders, he always managed to express his inner peace through exuberant <br/>phrases. A combination of Holdsworth and Hendrix.  <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/> <br/><b>Jason Becker</b> <br/>It's a big shame that he&#8217;s consigned by many to oblivion due to his tragedy. That Jason caught <br/>ALS was the biggest loss in metal history. Jason is the GOAT of sweep picking. No one ever <br/>close. His harmonies (especially with echo/delay effect) showcased his terrific grasp of <br/>classical composition and rhythmic accuracy. Together with Marty, he startled the guitar <br/>community with their miracles in Cacophony. <br/> <br/><b>Steve Vai</b> <br/>If Hendrix and Zappa had a child who could shred effortlessly. This guy really played it cool! <br/>Also the one who got the most out of Zappa. <br/> <br/><b>Marty Friedman</b> <br/>A humble magician who orchestrated grotesquely exotic elements in heavy metal. Incredible <br/>timing. Always seems to be out of tempo but always in the groove. <br/> <br/><b>Paul Masvidal</b> <br/>With Jason Gobel, he permanently changed the way to play metal guitar, which propagates to <br/>present (the solo of &#8216;Cosmos&#8217; set the new rules). He was the first to bring Holdsworth&#8217;s <br/>otherworldly ideas to metal. Through intricate, revolutionary arrangements, he pondered <br/>abstruse philosophical questions such as existentialism and self-acceptance. Focus is my <br/>all-time favourite metal album!  <br/> <br/><b>Pat Metheney</b> <br/>Best swing in rock, best rock in swing.  <br/> <br/><b>Andy Timmons</b> <br/>The ultimate controller of DYNAMICS and melodies. Shredding with overflowing emotions. <br/> <br/><b>Gary Moore</b> <br/>Blues. Shredding. Expressions. The only successor of Rory and Peter.  <br/> <br/><b>Eric Johnson</b> <br/>He invented the creamy, smooth fuzzy lead tone for lavish super-pentatonic runs and the <br/>crystal, nitid rhythm tone for euphoric chord progressions. It&#8217;s always a sunny, breezy spring <br/>day to listen to his music. <br/> <br/><b>Frank Gambale</b> <br/>Another shredding fusion pro who appeared in &#8216;Truth in Shredding&#8217; with Holdsworth and in <br/>&#8216;Centrifugal Funk&#8217; with Lane. His distinct treatment of the 4ths distinguished himself from <br/>other fusion players.  <br/> <br/><b>Buckethead</b> <br/>Out of the kill-switch-manoeuvred 80s hard rock grooves, Lane-Gilbert-style legatos, John <br/>Zorn&#8217;s free jazz anarchy, P-Funk-infused occult, and Primus-inspired circus eccentricities, <br/>Brian Carroll forged BUCKETHEAD. Buckethead defines an uneducated nobleman. Buckethead <br/>is beyond a figure. As long as anyone in that mask starts to play guitar, Buckethead surfaces <br/>from underground. It is a parody of mass hypnosis. It is an invasion against the rebel-wannabe <br/>mainstream who intrinsically conforms. It is B for Bendetta. <br/> <br/><b>Alexi Laiho</b> <br/></p>
<p>6 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>Probably his most appalling technique is to sweep pick and growl simultaneously. The last <br/>neo-classical crusader. A martyr. A falling angel. An eternal icon for melodic death metal.  <br/> <br/><b>John Petrucci</b> <br/>His tenure in Dream Theater changed prog metal forever. He honoured his (Catholic) faith <br/>through unyielding discipline and flawless precision. One can feel the stoic composure and <br/>biblical wisdom from his delicate compositions. However, sometimes that sounds a bit <br/>mechanical.  <br/> <br/><b>Guthrie Govan</b> <br/>Many dismissed him as cringe, mistaking his exploration beyond his niche for folly. Rather, <br/>he&#8217;s the ultimate guitarist of this age that no longer venerates guitar heroes anymore. He&#8217;s <br/>able to play whatever he wants to hear, whatever others want to hear, and whatever no one <br/>wants to hear but should be heard. In my view, his only limitation remains that he builds most <br/>of his melodies over the country &#8216;chicken&#8217; cliches. <br/> <br/><b>Al Di Meola</b> <br/>Return To Forever! But I gotta acknowledge that he&#8217;s not as good as McLaughlin, given that <br/>Chick Corea contributed more to the project. Thus, he&#8217;s a bit lower in the quadrant.  <br/> <br/><b>Joe Satriani</b> <br/>Melodic master who interprets Hendrix in a unique way. Stunning live shows but lame <br/>records.  <br/> <br/><b>Nuno Bettencourt</b> <br/>Heaviness and passion in a funky pocket! A sub-branch of Hillel&#8217;s legacy. A few solos sound <br/>weird tho. <br/> <br/><b>Ritchie Blackmore</b> <br/>He initiated the &#8216;mechanical&#8217; style of playing. Very powerful. <br/> <br/><b>Eddie Van Halen</b>  <br/>Although some songs sound very corny, no one tapped and ERUPTED like he did! (There&#8217;re <br/>way more interesting tappers like TJ Helmerich, who I&#8217;d place on the upper right corner were <br/>there space left, but Eddie&#8217;s tapping dynamics are really unique. No one can tap with so much <br/>attack.)  <br/> <br/><b>Greg Howe</b> <br/>Groove, agility, feels like a marble bouncing around. It&#8217;s hard to believe that he used to be a <br/>YJM kind of neo-classical shredder. I should have added Tony MacAlpine as well, somewhere <br/>near Howe, for they are somehow similar.  <br/> <br/><b>Plini</b> <br/>His music might not sound that catchy (partially due to the dsp quad cortex), but the way he <br/>turned the tracks upside down is really smart. Many people overlooked his effort to <br/>compensate for his technical limitations as a djent player. <br/> <br/><b>Randy Rhoads</b> <br/>Ozzy rules, so Randy rules too. But Randy was not the only one who served Ozzy. <br/> <br/><b>Richie Kotzen</b> <br/></p>
<p>7 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>People need to realise that he&#8217;s a different kind of 80s hard rock shredder. Check out his guest <br/>solo in Ner Ner (Guthrie Govan)! <br/> <br/><b>Nick Johnston</b> <br/>I should have put Steve Lukather here to share the same spot with Nick. Both represent <br/>ultra-melodic, progressive interpretations of Hendrix in different eras. <br/> <br/><b>Tosin Abasi</b> <br/>I used to view him as a technocrat. Later I felt how soulful and exotic his chords could be. I <br/>appreciate him for being an icon of djent instead of blues/rnb. Coming from an African <br/>neighbourhood, he chose to be ABASI himself.  <br/> <br/><b>Vinnie Moore</b> <br/>His versatility is manifested in neo-classical shredding, lyrical Gilmour-style solos, and crystal <br/>clear finger picking. &#8216;Rain&#8217; really touches me.  <br/> <br/><b>Alex Hutchings</b> <br/>Guthrie Govan but not that Guthrie Govan, still awesome tho.  <br/> <br/><b>Paul Gilbert</b> <br/>I&#8217;m always terrified by his alternate picking and timing, but sometimes his licks got too cliche.  <br/> <br/><b>Mateus Asato</b> <br/>Anyone would melt for his tasty Hendrixy double stops and sweet voicings. However, he&#8217;s too <br/>pop. <br/> <br/><b>Dimebag Darrel</b> <br/>Bro liked to bullshit a lot, but the beauty of his coarseness is unmatched.  <br/> <br/><b>Alex Lifeson</b> <br/>I won&#8217;t consider him a prog rock player, but he&#8217;s interesting enough as a hard rock guitarist.  <br/> <br/><b>Jack Gardiner</b> <br/>The most trendy shredder so far. Those &#8216;outside&#8217; super-pentatonic licks are substantially <br/>useful and cool. Anyway, he&#8217;s too pop and lacks depth.  <br/> <br/><b>Mark Knopfler <br/></b>Characteristic, esoteric finger picking skills. Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing are <br/>absolutely bangers. Other works remain mediocre. <br/> <br/><b>Jerry Cantrell</b> <br/>The true grunge guitar hero. Cooler than Cobain.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p><b>Centrist Point <br/></b> <br/><b>Jimmy Page</b> <br/>Very classic. But I seldom find anything interesting from him. Hendrix could do everything he <br/>did. <br/> <br/><b>Stevie Ray Vaughan</b> <br/></p>
<p>8 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>Sublime control over dynamics. The only 013 gauge conqueror. Hendrix couldn&#8217;t do everything <br/>he did, but he&#8217;s a kind of reactionary movement against Hendrix. Hendrix freed blues from the <br/>norms and cliches, while SRV brought them back under a polished cover. Deplorable blues <br/>fundamentalists like Albert King preferred SRV over Hendrix.  <br/> <br/> <br/></p>
<p><b>Green Quadrant <br/></b> <br/><b>Keiji Haino</b> <br/>Bro bullshitted so much that he&#8217;s somehow outside the matrix. I don&#8217;t know where to place <br/>him. Sometimes he&#8217;s entertaining. <br/> <br/><b>Jack White</b> <br/>This guy mistook corniness and shallowness for minimalism. Unqualified guitar player. I can&#8217;t <br/>listen to him for a single second. Any football club anthem outplays Seven Nations Army. <br/> <br/><b>Keith Richards</b> <br/>I can&#8217;t pretend that he&#8217;s a decent guitarist simply for his spell with the Rolling Stones. <br/> <br/><b>Johnny Greenwood</b> <br/>My brutal honesty. Radiohead is crap. Radiohead is an incel version of The Smith. Radiohead <br/>initiated incel in rock music. Radiohead is the biggest scam in the history of alternative/indie <br/>rock. I came to a consensus with Scaruffi on this topic. And I am even harsher. Creep is the <br/>worst song that ever existed in the past decades. Its main problem is actually ethics. <br/>Radiohead had received lawsuits from The Hollies for Creep copying The Air That I Breathe. <br/>Unfortunately, The Hollies lost. The entire vocal melody came from the Hollies song. What's <br/>more disgusting, STP released their own Creep on 29 Sep, 1992. 358 days later, Radiohead <br/>released the same titled shit that shared almost the same chord progression with the original <br/>one (thanks god, they added a Cm to make the teacher not suspect that they got the entire <br/>cheat sheet before the exam). I was shocked by the absence of a lawsuit from STP and the <br/>despicable fact that no one has ever pointed it out. I didn't place Greenwood on the bottom, <br/>because the creepiness of this band should be mainly attributed to Thom Yorke, a sheer Creep <br/>for his life. His stingy, ugly face does reveal something inside. Anyway, I have zero tolerance <br/>for that Johnny Greenwood, an Oxford student (tho dropped out) who received extensive <br/>classical music training, had to commit plagiarism against 2 generic songs with little editing to <br/>come up with his own &#8216;original banger.&#8217; I&#8217;ve seen tons of jazz students saying Creep was the <br/>best rock song. I mourn for their parents who paid for their conservatory education (however, <br/>modern formal musical education is getting worse for real). The only legit Radiohead album is <br/>In Rainbows. <br/> <br/><b>Angus Young</b> <br/>A rock classic who made a lot of contributions. Yet I can&#8217;t stand his stereotype. His solos are <br/>boring as well. <br/> <br/><b>Richie Sambora</b> <br/>Bon Jovi stands for corny crackers, but Sambora&#8217;s solo works are better. <br/> <br/><b>Kingfish <br/></b></p>
<p>9 </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>I was fooled by him for a while. In the end, I found him not bluesy at all. As an Asian guy in <br/>glass, even I got more groove than him. His rhythm sounds so &#8216;Aryan&#8217; that it was deprived of <br/>any Delta or African origins. Bro should stop playing the identity card. <br/> <br/><b>Kurt Cobain</b> <br/>While (almost) hymning Buckethead, I said he was an invasion against the misfit-wannabe <br/>mainstream NPCs. When Cobain was alive, he was the leader of these NPCs. After he died, he <br/>became the totem of these NPCs. Before him, way cooler people had already done way cooler <br/>things. In the community of Grunge, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains did that. Before Grunge <br/>appeared, Gibby Haynes pioneered the delirious punk scene with his Butthole Surfers as well <br/>(later Gibby Haynes and Johnny Depp produced the short documentary &#8216;The Stuff&#8217; about John <br/>Frusciante.)! Besides, Cobain stood for an image of woke nihilism and self loathing, which, <br/>sadly, was perpetuated over the past decades (especially among the youth) through countless <br/>reproductions of his commercial mirage. The nihilism and self-loathing were obviously <br/>exhaled by his bullshitting, demented riffs (Being demented or delirious is no big problem, but <br/>he sucked at structural composition.). However, for Smell Like Teen Spirits, Lithium, and You <br/>Know You&#8217;re Right that accompanied me during my salad days, I didn&#8217;t put him on the bottom.  <br/> <br/><b>Neil Young</b> <br/>Very good song writer. However, he didn&#8217;t behave himself like Lou Reed did. I was shocked by <br/>his improvised solos on stage, and it seemed that he didn&#8217;t feel embarrassed at all.  <br/> <br/><b>Brian May</b> <br/>Not interesting. Not original. I&#8217;d rather him be a full-time astronomical physicist. <br/>Nevertheless, like everyone else, I acknowledge Bohemian Rhapsody.  <br/> <br/><b>Eric Clapton</b> <br/>He sold the most. However, all the blues players in the red quadrant can easily blow him off. <br/>That&#8217;s my red pill theory on guitar. We&#8217;ve been lied to about history. If you listen carefully, he <br/>could by no means outcompete people like Rory. Besides, he&#8217;s not original. A lot of his licks are <br/>Hendrix ripoffs. It&#8217;s not cool of him to do so with a contemporary artist.  <br/> <br/><b>John Mayer</b> <br/>Technically flawless. Versed in both picking and finger style. Skanking master. But it&#8217;s <br/>shameful of him to squander his talent by consistently making pop albums. Bro overrated the <br/>human race if he truly believed that we still need decades of generic gay ballads to add to the <br/>masses that came before.  <br/> <br/><b>Billy Gibbons</b> <br/>Why did he think it cool to hold a 10-string guitar to play some blues rock licks that only <br/>required 6 strings? When I saw him for the first time, I thought he played djent.  <br/> <br/><b>Pete Townshend</b> <br/>Bro&#8217;d better keep in mind that it was John Entwistle who carried him all the way. The windmill <br/>strum is primal. <br/> <br/><b>George Harrison</b> <br/>Please refer to scaruffi.com for any Beatles-related controversies. The Beatles made beautiful, <br/>adorable songs, but they are very overrated, and Harrison was not an excellent guitar player. <br/> <br/><b>Derek Trucks</b> <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>Oh yes king of the slide tube. But just boring &#8212;&#8212; most modern blues revivers are boring in <br/>this way, for their main mission is to repeat the previous ones rather than to find <br/>transcendental ways. <br/> <br/><b>Thurston Moore</b> <br/>I genuinely don&#8217;t want to get noise punk people in this chart, but he&#8217;s always in the Rolling <br/>Stone top guitarists list. And he shouldn&#8217;t be there. He has a way to approach the riffs, but it <br/>doesn&#8217;t make him special. Gang of Four did that better.  <br/> <br/><b>Ace Frehley</b> <br/>Most Kiss songs are unacceptably corny. However, Ace was real. He learned to play guitar <br/>without even knowing what a pentatonic scale is. His major strength lies in his energy in live <br/>shows. I remember he once played a guitar on fire. RIP Ace &#55357;&#56687;&#65039;(written on 17 Oct, 2025) <br/> <br/><b>The Edge</b> <br/>U2 was my religion in my first two years of high school. The Edge was supposed to be on the <br/>axis, but I didn&#8217;t want his name to be covered by the thick arrow. The Edge wrote a lot of <br/>minimalist, ethereal clean riffs that I genuinely enjoyed. However, I wonder what his reaction <br/>is when his delay pedal is broken.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p><b>Purple Quadrant <br/></b> <br/><b>John Skyes</b> <br/>He had a few astounding solos in Whitesnake. Yet mediocre in general. <br/> <br/><b>Zakk Wylde</b> <br/>King of pentatonic shredding with iconic chorus lead tone. But it&#8217;s literally merely 5 notes. <br/>Somehow hypnotic. <br/> <br/><b>Allen Collins</b> <br/>He deserves kudos for improvising the Free Bird solo. However, there were too many repeated <br/>phrases (no rhythmic or effect change) and hardly any transition from major blues scale to <br/>minor blues scale. He played with feels and flow but lacked prudence. <br/> <br/><b>Matteo Mancuso</b> <br/>The most trendy fusion rising star with classical finger picking. Occasionally, he came up with <br/>extremely technical yet tasteful jams. Nonetheless, I found many of his long phrases failed to <br/>hit the point. He poorly connects the long runs. I look forward to seeing him making progress <br/>and becoming the second Holdsworth or at least Di Meola. <br/> <br/><b>Michael Romeo</b> <br/>Another technical shredder but barely anything memorable. <br/> <br/><b>Yngwie J Malmsteen</b> <br/>Every time when people claim he&#8217;s the godfather of neo-classical shredding, I&#8217;d try my best <br/>defending Uli Jon Roth. Uli started neo-classical shredding with his 32-fret sky guitar. What <br/>YJM mainly did was to copy Paganini&#8217;s passages. I appreciate his efforts in doing this, but that <br/>doesn&#8217;t make him very original, let alone that Uli did it earlier. Besides, were it not for the 008 <br/>gauge, he&#8217;d not be able to play that fast. <br/> <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/><b>Jason Richardson</b> <br/>Just techniques, techniques, and techniques. <br/> <br/><b>Slash</b> <br/>As my very first guitar hero, Slash defined rock n roll with so many GnR classics. However, as a <br/>media of the most orthodox &#8216;Rock n Roll&#8217; culture, his playing style inevitably falls into one of <br/>the biggest corny cliches. With a custom Les Paul and a Marshall Silver Jubilee, he failed to <br/>refine his tone or at least to maximise the raw effect. More importantly, he made little <br/>progress over the years. There are countless footage of him failing on stage on the internet <br/>now.  <br/> <br/><b>Hideto</b> <br/>X JAPAN popularised visual kei. Visual kei catalysed ACG. ACG sucks. In terms of techniques, <br/>there&#8217;s nothing special about him except his excessive use of triplets. He&#8217;s not comparable to <br/>his western counterparts.  <br/> <br/><b>George Lynch</b> <br/>Like many other glam metal bands, Dokken sounds like video games for pupils.  <br/> <br/><b>Kirk Hammet</b> <br/>Without James Hetfield, bro&#8217;s cooked. Dave Mustaine is a better lead guitarist than Kirk. I also <br/>got confused why he&#8217;s crowned as the king of wah. Frusciante, Petrucci, Buckethead, Prince&#8230; <br/>I can list an A4 paper of names who get along better with the wah effect than he does.  <br/> <br/><b>Synyster Gates</b> <br/>Serving A7X, he played a lot of flashy solos with flashy arpeggios, but his formulaic phrases <br/>lack tensions in general.  <br/> <br/><b>Andy James</b> <br/>A maverick shredder who doesn&#8217;t like using his pinky. His phrases are actually pretty decent <br/>but just in the wrong context. What he finally came up with is no different than generic pop <br/>music.  <br/> <br/><b>Michael Angelo Batio</b> <br/>Being ambidextrous doesn&#8217;t make you better. Nothing but showboating. <br/> <br/><b>John 5</b> <br/>A parody of Buckethead. If you are not autistic at all, never play Buckethead. Just like Marilyn <br/>Manson, John 5 could only formulate phrases that appeal to the pretentious gothic kids. The <br/>&#8216;neo-classical&#8217; pieces he attempted with extravagant MV settings sound like a golden toilet <br/>placed somewhere in Dubai &#8212;&#8212; it&#8217;s made of gold, but sadly it is supposed to accommodate <br/>excrement.  <br/> <br/><b>Tim Henson</b> <br/>The golden toilet metaphor applies to him too. He&#8217;s extraordinarily talented in compiling <br/>sophisticated yet swanky riffs, but one can hardly be touched or (conceptually) inspired by <br/>them. 99% of them are hollow and soulless. It&#8217;s acrobatics but not music. <br/> <br/><b>Manuel Gardner Fernandes</b> <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> <br/>Neymar Jr? This guy falls into the same category with Henson. I was not sure whether his <br/>&#8216;thrash&#8217; was rage bait. He was also charged with faking and speeding some of his clips. Maybe I <br/>shouldn&#8217;t get him here, or I should add Giacomo Turra somewhere below the purple quadrant. <br/> <br/><b>Joe Bonamassa</b> <br/>A parody of Eric Johnson and many other blues figures. Before Joe Bonamassa, I&#8217;ve never seen <br/>any blues player dressed up like an overnight millionaire. His flashy licks are often in a mess. <br/>He doesn&#8217;t pay enough attention to his dynamics. He doesn&#8217;t fall into any of the sub categories <br/>of blues: no matter Texan, Delta, country, or whatever. He plays gentrified suburban blues. <br/>The style he concocted symbolizes the vanity of suburban philistines: they despise the urban <br/>elites and bourgeoises. Meanwhile, they distance themselves from the poor &#8216;red necks&#8217; who do <br/>conserve the culture. <br/> <br/><b>Tom Morello</b> <br/>John Frusciante did the cable solo in 1989, long before Tom regularised it. Other than cable <br/>solo, digitech whammy, and crushing the switch, he had no other outstanding tricks. His clean <br/>riffs in Audioslaves are mostly ripoffs from Red Hot Chili Peppers, especially after the release <br/>of By The Way. Basically, all the American commies are brain dead and have poor tastes. <br/>Unlike their Soviet fellows (i.e. Kino, Alyanz), they lack virility and composure.  <br/> <br/><b>Philip Sayce</b> <br/>It is not necessary at all to strum all the notes. Zero sense of dynamics. The riffs he composed <br/>are more catastrophic. They sound like beginner strumming exercises for pretentious <br/>&#8216;contemporary&#8217; bands like Black Midi.  <br/> <br/><b>My guilty pleasures in the lower quadrants: The Edge (U2), Ace Frehley (Kiss), Zakk Wylde <br/>(Black Label Society, Ozzy) <br/></b> <br/>*Guitarists missed due to limited space: I really wanted to add Terry Kath in the blue <br/>quadrant. He&#8217;ll be at a very high position. And as I previously claimed, Tony MacAlpine and <br/>Steve Lukather deserve to be in the blue quadrant as well, so do Steve Morse, TJ Helmerich <br/>and Brett Garsed. Jerry Garcia should have been on the same spot with Trey Anastasio. There <br/>are surely millions of other maestros or clowns to be assigned with a spot in this chart, but it&#8217;s <br/>irresponsible of me to do so, as I either haven&#8217;t familiarised myself with them or have never <br/>checked them out.  <br/> <br/></p>
<p><b>Appendix II: Top 20 Electric (mostly rock) Guitarists of All <br/>Time <br/></b> <br/>*I&#8217;m not going to incorporate pre-Jimi blues figures like B. B. King or jazz masters like Django. <br/>They belong to a separate list.  <br/> <br/>1.&#8203; Jimi Hendrix, Allan Holdsworth (sharing the throne) <br/>2.&#8203; / <br/>3.&#8203; Shawn Lane <br/>4.&#8203; Steve Vai <br/>5.&#8203; Eddie Van Halen  <br/>6.&#8203; Prince <br/>7.&#8203; Frank Zappa <br/></p>

<p><b>Appendix III: Nominations for a few Acoustic Guitar GOATS <br/></b> <br/>John Fahey (solid no.1, the real GOAT, without sharing with anyone else) <br/>Jackson C. Frank <br/>Nick Drake <br/>Townes van Zandt <br/>Tim Buckley <br/>Joni Mitchell (not a DEI nomination) <br/>Paco de Lucia <br/>Al Di Meola (bro&#8217;s good at both) <br/> <br/>I&#8217;m reluctant to nominate any acrobatic acoustic &#8216;shredders&#8217; like Luca Stricagnoli (Luca is a <br/>super nice guy tho, I met him 3 years ago.), Sungha Jung, Mike Dawes, Trace Bundy, Kotaro <br/>Oshio, or the corniest Marcin (acoustic version of Tim Henson). Centurial electric shredders <br/>like EVH made a big difference. No matter how flashy the electric guitar is, it still serves as a <br/>track for the entire song. However, acoustic acrobats make naive attempts to replace the <br/>ensemble with some skateboard tricks on guitar. John Fahey didn&#8217;t try to replace the drum by <br/>frolicking with the body or pick-guard. Instead, he reached the electric-equivalent effects <br/>with candid, austere fingerpicking. He was the first to make ambient music with an acoustic <br/>guitar.  <br/> <br/></p>
