      <p>Hello! My name is Frank. I spent my first 18 years in Suzhou, China, and later I came to Amsterdam for my studies. Having graduated from AUC, I'm now doing MSc MADE (Metropolitan Analysis, Design, and Engineering) at AMS Institute. Being a guitar aficionado, I enjoy various genres of music, including rock, metal, funk, jazz fusion. etc. I'm also obsessed with Chinese classical music, especially Guqin, which I can play a little bit. Ting Quan is a motto I inherit from my families, who are passionate about music and arts. This website features my random thoughts on music and other stuff. Welcome to my wonderland!</p>
